# fun_school_projects
This is a repository that consists of some of the most fun projects I have completed and done throughout my Physics undergraduate degree. All of these classes were taken at A&M Univeristy. Each course had a few highlighting assignments and I wanted to share how I tackled these intoductory questions. This is all my own work, but the assignments and topics tackled given by the professor assigned to each course.



**ASTR 320: Astronomy Research 1**

Course Description: Background and tools used in modern astrophysical research, including reduction of photometric and spectroscopic data, signal-to-noise and error calculations and order-of-magnitude estimates. \
Taught by: Dr. Jennifer Marshall


**ASTR 420: Astronomy Research 2**

Course Description: Advanced research techniques used by modern-day astronomers to obtain, process and analyze data from grounds and space-based telescopes. \
Taught by: Dr. Jonelle Walsh \
These projects consists of Tutorials that describe the assignments given to the class throughout the semester. \
**[NOTE: I am currently working on uploading the code for each task completed, however it will take some time. This class was done with a vertual enviornment (Ubuntu) and I am still attempting to move over these large files onto my main machine.]**


**ASTR 401: Stars and ExtraSolar Planets**

Course Descrition: How stars are born, how internal structure changes, nuclear fuel burned and ultimate fate; extrasolar planet detection, formation, properties and habitability \
Taught by: Dr. Louis Stragari 

**ASTR 403: Extragalactic Astronomy**

Course Descrition: Physical makeup of individual galaxies and large scale structure in the universe; origin and eventual fate of the universe; interpretation of observational data as it relates to baryonic matter, Dark Matter and cosmological models with Dark Energy. \
Taught by: Dr. Lifan Wang 


**PHYS 327-328: Undergraduate Lab**

Course Descrition: Laboratory experiments in modern physics and physical optics with an introduction to current, state-of-the-art recording techniques. \
Taught by: Dr. George Welch \
This folder holds the lab reports that I enjoyed in my undergraduate physics lab.
